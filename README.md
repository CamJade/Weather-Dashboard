# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This website uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for searched cities. Local storage is used to store past city searches which can be clicked on to look back on.

## Usage
This application can be used to see current weather as well as a 5-day forcast for a city when searched. Once a city has been searched for, it is added to search history and can be accessed there. The UV index for the current weather is color-coded based on severity
